# bubblegum_thing
Virtual bookshelf for serial comic collections.

##Synopsis
This is an ongoing project. Its an app that allows the user to easily keep track of their comic book collection. The user can input a series title and issue number range and the result will display the comic cover art with meta data (creators, plot, cover date.) This app is built with Django and uses the requests library. It uses the comicvine.gamespot.com database.

##Motivation

I wanted a way to document my collection. Bubblegum thing will allow the user to quickly upload huge swaths of their collection quickly. The user can log into their account and peruse their rad collection, with out having to pull cardboard boxes from the attic. This is a work in progress and I plan to set up my own database with data from comics.org, so that I can customize it.
